                Swimming is the self-propulsion of a person through water, or other liquid, usually for recreation, sport, exercise, or survival.Locomotion is achieved through coordinated movement of the limbs and the body to achieve hydrodynamic thrust that results in directional motion. Humans can hold their breath underwater and undertake rudimentary locomotive swimming within weeks of birth, as a survival response.
